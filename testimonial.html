              I approached moovez because I needed help moving into a new
              apartment, but being a university student without a car, I had few
              options to help me out. Given that my schedule was packed with
              exams and assignments, I didn’t have time to rent a vehicle, and
              considering all of my friends are in the same boat with not having
              access to a car, I contacted moovez. moovez helped me greatly, even
              going to the extent of packing up the items I had left in the side
              yard of my current apartment, as I was in the middle of an exam
              when I needed my things moved. They loaded, delivered, and
              unloaded my things, ensuring they were in safe hands, all while I
              was busy.
              <br /><br />
              I was surprised at how much was done with just a few taps on my
              phone prior to going into my exam, and by the time I had finished,
              the boxes of things I had left were delivered and ready to be
              unpacked in my new apartment. I can hardly put into words the
              relief that I felt having my things delivered in such an easy
              manner, while still allowing me to take care of other things that
              I needed to get done. The practicality is my personal favorite
              aspect of using moovez as a service.
              <br /><br />
              With just a tap, a driver was on the way to pick up my things and
              bring them to my new place, and I usually would have to go through
              a process of going into a rental place, signing a bunch of
              paperwork, and doing the labor myself, which can be a whole day
              process! I would absolutely recommend the service to any of my
              friends who are in a similar position, as well as anyone with a
              busy schedule. Sometimes life gets in the way, and we can’t always
              get certain items where they need to, but moovez makes that process
              so much easier. <br /><br />

              STAR RATING – 5/5
