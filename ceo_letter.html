              The past decade of Simon’s life has been delivery, delivery and
              more delivery. It was a chance encounter on the streets of
              Beijing, of all places, he got his first introduction into the
              tech logistics world.
              <br />
              <br />

              While at a real estate agency, looking for shelter two weeks after
              landing in his new city, he bumped into two founders of a recently
              launched food delivery startup called Jinshisong. It didn’t take
              long for Simon to join the team. This was cutting edge at the
              time. The tech driven food delivery explosion had not hit China
              yet but they knew it was coming. They were the first movers in
              Beijing and it was exciting to be apart of that early core group.
              <br />
              <br />

              After acquiring tremendous experience and a lot of learning, it
              came time for Simon to leave as he had ambitions to start his own
              venture in China. It was somewhat accidental again but he
              cofounded and became CEO of a healthy meal plan subscription
              service called Doko. The first three years of operation were
              exclusively driven by an online ordering system and delivery. By
              year four, three storefronts were opened but delivery remained a
              core part of the business.
              <br />
              <br />
              He achieved his goal of starting a company in China but as they
              say, all good things must come to an end. Following his exit from
              the company, Simon decided it was time to head home. China ignited
              the startup flame but he knew the next one was going to be on home
              turf with home field advantage.
              <br />
              <br />
              moovez is a culmination of that East-West experience. As a witness
              and small participant in a country that transformed into a tech
              and logistics powerhouse, Simon was able to bring this unique
              perspective back with him and identify areas where Canada lagged
              behind. He realized almost immediately the logistics industry was
              in serious need of innovation. Teaming up with Saroj Acharya as
              lead Technical Advisor, they set out to build a platform that will
              provide an innovative solution to an out-of-date industry.
              <br />
              <br />
              They look forward to delivering on their promise that moovez will
              transform the way Canadians move their stuff.
