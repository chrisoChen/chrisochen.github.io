              A question you might have is why would I need someone else to move
              my things? The simple answer is, life gets in the way sometimes.
              Whether it’s a lack of time, not a big enough car, or any other
              reason, we are here to help you move your things quickly and
              efficiently, because life gets in the way!

              Imagine this: you have a big move planned for a weekend, and have
              to have everything moved by Sunday night. On Friday, a game of
              softball goes awry, and you throw out your back, leaving you in
              pain and unable to lift things. Now, usually, this would be a very
              tough scenario to be a part of, given the urgency of the move, but
              the inability to complete it. Well, these issues are not a worry
              anymore. With a couple of taps on your mobile device or computer,
              we can have a driver arrive at location ‘A’, pack up your things,
              deliver them to location ‘B’, and drop them off. We are made to be
              a solution when life gets in the way! Don’t let life get in the
              way of moving into your dream home!

              Say you have just bought your dream desk off of a second-hand
              website. It’s the perfect desk to compliment your office space,
              solid oak, amazing finish. It was a matter of time until fate made
              sure that desk was part of your office. You grab the money, hop in
              your car, and go pick up the desk of your dreams. Except when you
              go to pick up the desk, it is way bigger than you expected, and
              will definitely not fit in the back of your car. This desk is
              perfect, but it doesn’t fit? What ever will you do!?! Simple.
              Order a cargo van off of our app, load the desk in, and meet the
              driver back at your home. Don’t let life get in the way of the
              office of your dreams!

              Sunday night hockey intramural league. You and your team, the
              ‘commerce comrades’ are in the final. Against who? Your
              arch-rival, the ‘engineering enigmas’. People may say ‘it’s only
              intramurals!’, but you know that isn’t true. This is as serious as
              the Stanley Cup. As you wait for your buddy to pick you and your
              roommates up, you get a text from him. ‘My truck broke down, had
              to bring the small car’. That’s not good. His car barely fits you
              and your roommates, where is the equipment going to go? You start
              to panic, worried that this will be a nightmare end to a dream
              season. But, you have no reason to worry. Open our app, order
              another vehicle for your equipment, meet our driver at the rink,
              pick up your gear, win the title. Don’t let life get in the way of
              intramural glory!
