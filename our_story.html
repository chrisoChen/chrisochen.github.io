                  We’ve taken the common scenario of that one friend with a
                  truck who always gets called on to help when you need
                  something moved and we’ve opened it up to the world.

                moovez was created so that everyone can have “that one friend”,
                always available and happy to help at the touch of a button. Our
                mission, with the help of our technology, is to connect
                customers with registered driver partners to deliver almost
                anything of any size. By seamlessly connecting users and
                drivers, a world of opportunities open up. Drivers can use their
                vehicles and labour to help people that need it and users can
                free up a little more time in their day to focus on other
                things.

              <p>
                Our driver partners operate a wide variety of vehicles to suit
                any delivery. We've eliminated the need to take a trip down to
                the rental counter to find a vehicle. We come to you. No more
                lines and no more paperwork. We partner with drivers of
                privately owned vehicles and business vehicles to offer a full
                range of delivery options. We also help businesses create a new
                stream of revenue by better utilizing their fleet.

              We're also a very good friend for your business. We work with
              businesses of all sizes to solve their delivery challenges. Retail
              stores, restaurants, construction companies, gas stations,
              ecommerce platforms, and more. Whether it’s your last-mile
              delivery issues or finding a reliable solution to transport
              inventory each day, we’ve made it so you no longer need to invest
              in running and maintaining a delivery fleet in-house. Businesses
              that choose moovez reduce the number of delivery related headaches,
              save time, and save money. Our unique tech advantage gives your
              business access to a massive fleet of vehicles. Vehicles which can
              be scheduled in advanced or booked on-demand for those last minute
              emergency deliveries. Our multi-stop function allows you to send
              one vehicle to multiple destinations and our real-time tracking
              allows you to know exactly where the delivery is at all times. You
              can cut and significantly reduce the cost of running and
              maintaining your own delivery fleet. Or you can better utilize the
              fleet you already have by joining moovez and having each of your
              vehicles become revenue generators for your business. Each extra
              delivery earns your business money. Any delivery made on the app
              is fully protected with auto and cargo liability insurance so you
              can rest assured your business is in safe hands.
