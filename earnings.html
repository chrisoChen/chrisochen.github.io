                        Pay is a combination of the base fair, delivery
                        distance, labour fee (if added), tips (if added) and the
                        service fee. Generally the biggest part of your earnings
                        comes from the delivery fee and that is calculated:
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        • ≤50km the customer pays $0.90/per km <br />
                        • >50km, the customer pays $0.50/per km <br />
                        <br />
                        Our platform charges the customer a flat rate for our
                        service but there are no additional charges to you. When
                        you accept a delivery from the driver dashboard, the
                        amount you see posted is what you’ll receive when the
                        delivery is successfully completed.

                        The easy answer is, drive when and where it’s the
                        busiest. Urban centres with higher population density
                        will have more potential customers. Be prepared to drive
                        during popular delivery hours. Normal work hours will
                        target our business customers. Morning or evening
                        deliveries during the week will often come before or
                        after normal work hours. <br />
                        <br />

                        Be prepared to work when others don’t want to. Summer
                        months are popular for moving. Weekends are a popular
                        time for people to move, do renovations around the
                        house, go shopping for new furniture, etc. These
                        situations also offer an opportunity for delivery
                        support. That's where you come in. <br />
                        <br />
                        As you spend more time on the platform you’ll figure out
                        the best times to look for orders and find your niche.

                        size, you may respectfully communicate that to them. If
                        they’ve chosen a 1/2 load but it’s clearly closer to a
                        full load, you have the right to bring this to their
                        attention and ask if they’d be willing to adjust the

                        If the customer <b class="purp-bold">agrees</b>, they’ll
                        have to log into the app and adjust the load size in

                        to make the delivery, you have the right to cancel the
                        order. We hope cancellation can be avoided. It’s in no
                        one’s best interest to cancel the order since you’ve
                        already arrived at the pickup location.

                        Customers tend to be quite reasonable if you can show
                        them your request is justified. We’ve asked customers to
                        lean on the generous side and choose full load if it is
                        close. We ask you do the same, if it’s over a half load
                        but not quite a full load, it might be better just to
                        make the delivery and move on to the next order. It will
                        take up valuable time to dispute the load size with a
                        stubborn customer. Time is money, don’t waste it
                        arguing, just move on, make the delivery and give
                        yourself more time to pick up additional orders.

                        just a little attention to detail. Keep your vehicle
                        clean and tidy, show up prepared for the job, act in a
                        professional manner, be polite, speak with a smile on
                        your face and try to go above and beyond their
                        expectations. With minimal extra effort, the customer
                        will take notice and your ratings will quickly start to
                        improve.

                        No, if the customer cancels or you choose not to accept
                        an order, your rating won’t be impacted. <br />
                        <br />
                        If you repeatedly cancel orders after already accepting
                        them, your account will be flagged and investigated. If
                        this pattern continues you may be banned from the
                        platform. It’s a hassle for our customers to have to
                        re-input their delivery information so we ask that you
                        only accept orders once you’re certain you’ll be able to
                        deliver them. <br />
                        <br />
                        Things happen and we understand there may be times when
                        you have to cancel but we try to avoid this as much as
                        possible.
