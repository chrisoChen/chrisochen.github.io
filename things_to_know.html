              moovez is a new addition to your daily life. Chances are, this is a
              new way of moving your things, but have no fear – it is a much
              easier process than you may expect! So, you might be wondering how
              moovez works? Well, to answer some of those questions, here is a
              list of questions you may have!
              <br />
              <br />
            </p>
            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 1rem">What is moovez?</h3>
            <p>
              moovez, as a company, is committed to helping people transport
              their things easier than ever before. Instead of calling a friend,
              renting a truck, or carrying it yourself, moovez is the place to
              call for when you need help. Whether it is a large cabinet going
              to a new apartment or a pot of flowers for your grandmother,
              simply order a driver through the moovez app, and we will make sure
              the item gets from point A to point B in the quickest time
              possible. We currently operate in Alberta only, but keep an eye
              out in the future for further expansion!
              <br />
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 1rem">
              How Long Will It Take for A Delivery to Be Completed?
            </h3>
            <p>
              moovez operates through an instant order response system, meaning
              drivers will be on the road and ready to complete your delivery
              the second you place it. No more waiting in line at a rental shop,
              as after a few taps on our app, a delivery driver will be en route
              to help you out! The delivery time will depend on the distance
              between pickup and drop-off locations, but our drivers are
              committed to delivering your items as fast as possible!
              <br />
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 1rem">
              Am I Allowed to Be in The Delivery Vehicle with My Things?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Unfortunately, due to our safety policies, you cannot ride in the
              vehicle with your things. While similar, we are not a ride-sharing
              app, and can only perform deliveries of objects, not people.
              However, to put your mind at ease, we have a $??? Insurance policy
              with (insert insurance org.) to ensure that your things are in the
              safest of hands!
              <br />
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 1rem">How Much Will A Delivery Cost?</h3>
            <p>
              There is no ‘set’ delivery fee for each order, as every order will
              be different. The fee is calculated based on number of items,
              distance between locations, size of vehicle, and how much labor
              will be required of our drivers. Smaller orders that travel a
              small distance will cost less than a large order that travels
              across the city, for an example.
              <br />
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 1rem">
              Will There Be Ratings Like Other Apps?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Yes. Very similar to other apps that are of a similar nature to
              ours, there will be a rating system where the customer may rate
              the driver, and the driver may rate the customer. This will allow
              for us to monitor each experience for both our drivers and
              customers, and solve any potential issues that may come up.
              <br />
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 1rem">
              Are There Any Restrictions to What Can Be Delivered?
            </h3>
            <p>
              While there are no specific exclusions to what can be delivered,
              it is recommended that extremely valuable or fragile items are not
              delivered using this platform. Due to the busy nature of our
              drivers, it can be difficult to heed extreme caution every second
              of every order, and due to the fast-paced nature, we suggest that
              your most cherished and expensive items are transported utilizing
              a different method.
              <br />
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 1rem">
              How Will I Know Which Vehicle to Order?
            </h3>
            <p>
              When placing an order through our website, you will have the
              option of seeing the recommendations for certain items, as well as
              the measurements of our vehicles. For some items, the correct
              vehicle choice will be clear, but for the items that could be
              delivered by more than one, we are happy to give guidance on which
              will be the best vehicle for your delivery!
              <br />
